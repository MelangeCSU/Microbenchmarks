dp_fma_reg_4.c:
code for testing the peak for double precision. number of registers used per thread is 4
Input: <number of threads> <number of interations>
The output includes execution time in seconds, number of operations and the gflops achieved
Example: ./dp_fma_reg_4 8 100000
output :
Start testing double precision avx 4....
Elapsed time for double precision avx: 1.949589
Number of FP operations: 153600000000
GFlops: 78.478079
the final sum: 171.143295
End testing for double precision avx.


sp_fma_reg_4.c
code for testing peak performance for single precision. I don't remember how many number of registers should be used for single precision, this one is also using 4 registers per thread.
Input and output is the same as the above one.
