gcc -O2 -S -c foo.c
gcc -c -g -Wa,-a,-ad [other GCC options] foo.c > foo.lst
If you need to both get the assembly code and to compile/link the program, you
can either give the -save-temps option to GCC (which will leave all the
temporary files including the .s file in the current directory), or use the
-Wa,-aln=foo.s option which instructs the assembler to output the assembly
translation of the C code (together with the hex machine code and some
additional info) to the file named after the =.
